# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
⭕❌ A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players can challenge each other to win with X’s and O’s.
This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game provides a simple yet engaging experience, with automatic win detection and a reset option once a winner is determined.

🛠️ The game logic is powered by JavaScript, which manages the turns, checks for a winner, and updates the board dynamically. The game is designed for two players, where they alternate placing their respective marks (X or O) on the grid. Once a player wins, the game announces the winner and allows players to restart with a fresh board.

🎨 CSS is used to style the game board and ensure a clean, minimal interface. The layout is simple, with clear visual distinctions between the grid cells and the players’ marks. Responsive design ensures the game works smoothly on desktop and mobile browsers, making it accessible on various devices.

🚀 This project is a great exercise for beginners to learn basic game development with vanilla web technologies. It demonstrates how to implement game logic, handle user interaction, and create an interactive user interface. The game can easily be extended with features like a scoreboard, AI opponent, or advanced animations.
